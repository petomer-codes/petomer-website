<h2>Hi, I'm Paige (she/her) and welcome to my website!</h2>
<p>
  <img src="me-small.png" alt="My photo" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; width: 200px; border-radius: 50%;">
  I created this website to be a publicly accessible repository of my research and personal projects. I'm excited to have this platform to share my work and life with you.
</p>

<h3>Here's a bit about me, academically:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I am starting my PhD program in <strong>Biostatistics</strong> this fall at the University of Washington. You can read about my application process under the Posts section.</li>
  <li>I received my <strong>Bachelor of Arts</strong> in Applied Mathematics and Statistics from Macalester College (Twin Cities, MN) in 2024. My minors were <strong>Anthropology</strong> and <strong>Community & Global Health</strong>.</li>
  <li>While at Macalester, I completed an Honors project using causal inference in professional soccer data.</li>
  <li>I just finished a year as a research fellow in the Durham-Chapel Hill area, where my research used <strong>longitudinal modeling</strong> to look at associations between <strong>puberty and cancer</strong>.</li>
  <li>My <a href="Tomer_CV_website.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a> has more information, if you're curious.</li>
</ul>

<h3>A bit more about me, outside of math:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I'm from the <strong>Seattle area</strong> in Washington, so this summer, I'll be moving back home for the first time in 5 years.</li>
  <li>I love reading, running, and resting: my big 3!
    <ul>
      <li>I have had more free time this past year, so I have challenged myself to pick up books and genres that I normally would not read (i.e., <em>Straight</em> by Dick Francis).</li>
      <li>I started running about 2 years ago after playing soccer all of my life. I'm planning to run my first half marathon this fall in Seattle!</li>
      <li>And resting is resting, self-explanatory. I love laying in the sun or in my bed with my orange cat, Goose.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I also love to do yoga, try new food + recipes, and drink good coffee.</li>
</ul>
