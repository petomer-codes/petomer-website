title: Home advantage causes in professional soccer
---
 
Back at Macalester College, I completed an Honors Thesis on the causes of home advantage in professional soccer. Though a very well-researched topic, I wanted mine to have a specific focus on women's soccer data (of all the studies I found less than 5 that even mentioned women's sports let alone used their data). If you can't tell, my thesis was a bit of a different topic than I have previously or continued to work on. This project stemmed out of a final paper I was writing for a causal inference class my junior year; it only turned into a thesis when my advisor asked me what I was working on one fateful afternoon, and, after that, a year plus of work ensued... \\

I had the best time writing and reserchig this topic, and I am so grateful to my advisor and readers who encouraged me! I developed my coding, causal inference, and collaboration skills while learning about the research process. It also taught me that, though soccer remains a passion of mine, I want to continue down the path of health data. \

I know this is not the longest research spiel ever, but (I hope) it's quick overview of my background in causal (and soccer)! My final paper is publicly accessible [here](https://digitalcommons.macalester.edu/mathcs_honors/86/).
