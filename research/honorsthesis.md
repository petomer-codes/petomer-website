title: Home advantage causes in professional soccer
---
 
Back at Macalester College, I completed an Honors Thesis on the causes of home advantage in professional soccer. Though a very well-researched topic, I wanted mine to have a specific focus on women's soccer data (of all the studies I found less than 5 that even mentioned women's sports let alone used their data). If you can't tell, my thesis was a bit of a different topic than I have previously or continued to work on. This project stemmed out of a final paper I was writing for a causal inference class my junior year; it only turned into a thesis when my advisor asked me what I was working on one fateful afternoon, and, after that, a year plus of work ensued... \\

I know this is not the longest research schpeel ever, but I jsut wanted to give a quick overview of my background in causal (and soccer)! My final paper is publicly accessible here[].
