title: Biostatistics PhD Application Process

# My experience applying to Biostatistics PhD programs
I am so excited to be attending the Unviersity of Washington's Biostatistics PhD program this fall. This application experience was truly full of ups and downs, and posts by  by [Kat Hoffman](https://www.khstats.com/blog/phd-apps/), [Daniel Posmik](https://posmikdc.github.io/), and [Simon Couch](https://www.simonpcouch.com/blog/2021-03-15-apply-to-stats-grad-school/) helped me through. Since application season is now behind me, I wanted to contribute my own experience to the Biostatistics-PhD-Application-Process metasphere. \
\
First, though, I wanted to begin with a disclaimer: \
* I only applied for American universities for fall 2025 matriculation. My application process began normally, but the transition of power that occurred in January in the States drastically impacted the rest of my cycle. This administration proposed detrimental cuts to the NIH, which frightened (rightly so) and halted grants to many universities -- meaning that admissions were frozen for a long time, cohorts were cut, and offers were rescinded. I hope this was a temporary blip in the public health world, and that your cycle will be less impacted than mine, but it does mean some of my experiences will (_hopefully_) not be generalizable. 

## My Background: 
I am an American citizen born and raised in Pittsburgh, PA, but I attended middle and high school in Seattle, WA. I received my Bachelor of Arts from Macalester College, a small liberal arts school in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota. 
My major was Applied Mathematics and Statistics, with minors in Anthropology and Community & Global Health. I graduated _summa cum laude_ with Honors in Statistics, which I received after completing an Honors thesis my senior year.
My thesis stemmed from a Causal Inference class I took in my junior year spring, looking at the causes of home advantage in (specifically women's) professional soccer. I also had two health-focused research experiences at outside institutions (SIBDS @ Columbia; Study abroad independent study project @ Leiden University College -- The Hague).\
After graduating from Macalester, I moved to Durham-Chapel Hill, North Carolina, to start a position as a post-baccalaureate research fellow at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. There, I contributed to the Puberty and Cancer Group, part of the larger Epidemiology Branch. 
Despite being on the Epi side, my mentor and I worked together to develop projects for me that were highly technical with co-authors from the closely conjoined Biostatistics and Computational Biology Branch. 

## My Strengths: 
After doing a lot of reading, I decided that my strengths were as follows: 
* **Research fellowship:** My current job as a research fellow through the IRTA program has made me a better researcher and statistician. In this role, I have gotten to both lead and support publications.
* **Math & stats background:** For my bachelor's degree, I had to take a lot of the classes that programs either required or preferred, along with some statistics electives along the way. Taking these classes recently and doing well in them was a major strength of my application. 
* **Recommendation letters:** I had three strong letters from a former research advisor + professor, a former Real Analysis/Calculus professor, and my current PI. I covered the bases in these letters, with two speaking to my strengths and potential as a researcher, while the third talked about my mathematics background. 


## My Weaknesses:
* **No master's degree:** Not having an MS makes it a bigger commitment for schools to take you on -- it's at least another year of coursework combined with added uncertainty if a student is serious about a PhD.
* **Liberal arts background:** I am hesitant about putting this here -- but I was told not to apply to some schools because they do not accept many liberal arts students. On the flip side, some schools like liberal arts students, but it was a point of consideration during my process.
* **Differing research interests:** None of my research projects follow the same method or topic. Further, my Honors thesis was my largest completed project at the time of applying, which did not use health data (I made sure to address this discrepancy in my personal statement).

# Application Process 

## Where did I apply and why? 
I decided to apply to graduate programs in Biostatistics in September 2024 -- a little late. After conversations with mentors and family, I settled on my priorities in a program and decided that I wanted to go to a graduate program if it met all of my criteria. Therefore, I only  applied to 5 PhD programs and 1 Master's program, all in Biostatistics. Though 4/5 PhD programs had options to be considered for their Master's program if rejected from their PhD program, I selected that I would want to be considered for the MS for all four. \

In choosing programs, I was looking at:
* **Geography:** I wanted to be in a city with good public transit (I hate driving). 
* **Program requirements:** I did not take the GRE and did not have plans to; therefore, I ruled out all schools that required it.
* **Type of research:** I am interested in longitudinal modeling + causal inference, so I looked for faculty that overlapped with my interests.
* **Connections to outside institutions:** I wanted a program to be heavily intertwined with local institutions (i.e. state health departments, local hospitals, non-profits). This was super important to me because it shows a deep commitment to improving health outcomes, versus only researching them. Also, I am interested in working as an applied biostatistician either post-grad or as an internship, so these ties would also allow me to build my own network.
* **Recent graduate outcomes:** This was typically a question I asked in an interview, but I wanted to see diversity in the steps after graduating from the program.
* **Support system:** Though this wasn't a complete dealbreaker for me, it led me to consider schools that were near friends or family.
* **Program intensity and ranking:** Most programs post their typical 5-year timeline somewhere on their website -- I ensured that their timeline lined up seemed both challenging (which is a given) but also _doable_. I also considered ranking when I was making my list.

My list of schools is as follows:

|    School     | Program |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Boston University  | PhD  |
| Brown University  | PhD |
| Columbia University  | PhD |
| University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill  | PhD |
| University of Minnesota | Masters |
| University of Washington | PhD only |

## Materials
After I finalized the list of schools, it was time to start putting together my application materials. If possible, I highly recommend starting early and asking professionals in that field to look over your materials. 
### CV
Here is the [CV](/petomer-website/Tomer_CV_November2024.pdf) I used to apply to schools.  A few comments I received while revising my CV were: 
* If you are in the early stages of publications, describe the project and your role.
* Look at examples of CVs from young faculty in the field and structure your CV based on that. 
* Describe responsibilities using active language.

### Statement of purpose
The statement of purpose (IMO) is the most important part of your application -- which is a good thing! You have an opportunity to talk about _who you are_ and _why you want to get a PhD_. However, I found this to be a lot of pressure. \
Schools have different prompts for what they want you to talk about (which I amde sure to tailor each draft to their requests), but the overall message is generally the same: 
* Why are you pursuing a PhD.
* Why will you be a successful candidate in a PhD program.
* Why the school in question is the right fit for your PhD studies.
\
To write my first draft of the statement, I based it on one school's prompt to not get so overwhelmed. I felt that if I could nail down the three questions above, it would be easier to write the statement for the other schools. \
After finalizing a draft of this initial statement through agonizing read-throughs and edits from my mentors, I then went school by school to make personalized statements for each of them. This meant a lot of copy and pasting the sections about me from the original statement (the reasons I'm pursuing a PhD stayed the same), but the paragraphs about each school shifted. I made sure to highlight why I am applying to the school and how it connects with my long-term goals. For my final paragraph, I tried to place myself in the department by naming faculty who have research of interest. \

A basic outline of my statement looked like this (reminder: this is what I found that worked best conveyed myself to schools, and it may not work best for everyone):
1. Introduction: Who I am, how I became interested in biostatistics, and my overall reason for pursuing a PhD.
2. First body paragraph: Why the school/program? I would frequently mention the connections to local institutions here, because that was important to me.
3. Second body paragraph: Why I am will be a successful candidate at the school -- more details about who I am as a biostatistician, highlighting previous expeirences and strengths.
4. Third + fourth body paragraphs: Specific research projects that I have completed, using active language.
5. Fifth-sixth body paragraphs: How my previous experiences have shaped my research interests -> how my research interests fit into the school in question (naming specifc faculty + centers)
6. Seventh body paragraph: A short in summary statement further contextualizing how I will be successful at the school, and how the school will shape me.
\
I was also grateful to have proof-readers both outside of the field (shoutout to my parents for helping me edit when I couldn't look at it anymore) and whithin the field -- my current PI helped me restructure the statement early on to flow better. \

A few miscellanous tips I have that worked well for me: 
* Have the school's specifc prompt at the top of the document, and refer back to it constantly.
* Leave things out -- your CV has all of your experiences, so choose the ones that are most important / align with your story. 
* Research the school beforehand, so you have the specific faculty/centers in mind while writing your statement. 
* Active language! This was a big one for me, as I typically fall into a passive voice when writing in general but specifically when writing about myself. I read my SOP out loud to myself repeatedly and asked humanities-background friends to proofread it for me.
* For every overall project that you talk about, elucidate _specifcally_ how you contributed. 
* Do not say anything more than once -- space is limited, and why repeat something wwhen you can say something new about yourself. 

### Personal statement
I found that personal statement prompts widely differed between schools, with some not even requiring it. The typically centered around diversity and inclusion, asking about how my background and experiences make me abel to contribtue to/benefit from a school's community. Here, I talked about my volunteering and how making math accessible is a passion of mine. 

# Interview process
After submitting my applications in November, it was time to wait for schools to review them. I was lucky to be traveling home for the holidays with plenty of distractions which helped me navigate the month of December. However, I was definently refreshing my email at an exponential rate waiting for repsonses to come flowing in. I learned that universities not only differ from each other in their timeline, but differ from their previous year timelines. \
In December and January, I received three interview invites (Columbia - in-person interview day invite received in mid-December; Brown - virtual interview day invite received in mid January, one week before the day itself; UW - virtual 'informal' interview invite received late January for the following week) and one waitlist (Boston U - received early January, no interview). \

Interviews at all three schools looked wildly different. At Brown, I attended the virtual interview day, which was mostly talks from faculty and students in the department with 3 15-minute interviews built in with faculty I requested. The time limit of the interiews were a challenge, but all the faculty were friendly and the interviews themselves felt more like conversations. \

My next interview was with University of Washington in early February. This was a more formal interview style than I experienced at Brown. I met with two faculty (the chair and a professor in the department) who had a set list of questions they wanted to ask me. The interview was scheduled to be 30-minutes, but lasted about an hour. Their questions ended around the 20-minute mark, but they asked if I had any questions -- so the last part of that hour was more of an informal conversation than the first part, with conversation stemming from the questions I asked them. \

My last interview was in-person at Columbia. The day was very similar to Brown's interview day, with an overview of the department from the chair, research talks from faculty, and time to meet with students. There were 3 20-minute interviews built in as well. These were very conversational, though I had studied at Columbia before so I knew two of the faculty I was interviewing with which may have helped.
