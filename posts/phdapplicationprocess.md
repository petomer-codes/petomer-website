title: Biostatistics PhD Application Process

# My experience applying to Biostatistics PhD programs
This fall, I will be attending the University of Washington's Biostatistics PhD program; I am so excited and grateful for this opportunity! This application experience was truly full of ups and downs, and posts by  [Kat Hoffman](https://www.khstats.com/blog/phd-apps/), [Daniel Posmik](https://posmikdc.github.io/), and [Simon Couch](https://www.simonpcouch.com/blog/2021-03-15-apply-to-stats-grad-school/) helped me through. Since application season is now behind me, I wanted to contribute my own experience to the Biostatistics-PhD-Application-Process sphere. \
\
First, though, a disclaimer: 
* I applied for fall 2025 matriculation to only American universities. My application process started normally, but the transition of power in January '25 in the States drastically impacted the rest of my cycle. The new administration proposed detrimental cuts to the NIH, which halted grants to many universities -- meaning that admissions were frozen for a long time, cohorts were cut, and offers were rescinded. I hope this was a temporary blip in the public health world, and that your cycle will be less impacted than mine, but it does mean some of my experiences will (_hopefully_) not be generalizable. 

## My Background: 
I am an American citizen born and raised in Pittsburgh, PA, but I attended middle and high school in Seattle, WA. I received my Bachelor of Arts from Macalester College, a small liberal arts school in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota. 
My major was Applied Mathematics and Statistics, with minors in Anthropology and Community & Global Health. I graduated _summa cum laude_ with Honors in Statistics, which I received after completing an Honors thesis my senior year.
My thesis stemmed from a Causal Inference class I took in my junior year spring, looking at the causes of home advantage in (specifically women's) professional soccer. I also had two health-focused research experiences at outside institutions (SIBDS @ Columbia; Study abroad independent study project @ Leiden University College -- The Hague).\
After graduating from Macalester, I moved to Durham-Chapel Hill, North Carolina, to start a position as a post-baccalaureate research fellow at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. There, I contributed to the Puberty and Cancer Group, part of the larger Epidemiology Branch. 
Despite being on the Epi side, my mentor and I developed highly technical projects with co-authors from the closely conjoined Biostatistics and Computational Biology Branch. 

## My Strengths: 
After doing a lot of reading, I decided that my strengths were as follows: 
* **Research fellowship:** My current job as a research fellow through the IRTA program has made me a better researcher and statistician. In this role, I have gotten to both lead and support publications. Having research experience (and future first-authored papers) was a strength of my application.
* **Math & stats background:** For my bachelor's degree, I had to take a lot of the classes that programs either required or preferred, along with some statistics electives along the way. Taking these classes recently and doing well in them was a major strength of my application. 
* **Recommendation letters:** I had three strong letters from a former research advisor + professor, a former Real Analysis/Calculus professor, and my current PI. I covered the bases in these letters, with two speaking to my strengths and potential as a researcher, while the third talked about my mathematics background. 


## My Weaknesses:
* **No master's degree:** Not having an MS made it a bigger commitment for schools to take me on -- it's at least another year of coursework combined with added uncertainty if a student is serious about a PhD.
* **Liberal arts background:** I am hesitant about putting this here -- but I was told not to apply to some schools because they do not accept many liberal arts students. On the flip side, some schools like liberal arts students, but it was a point of consideration during my process.
* **Differing research interests:** None of my research projects follow the same method or topic. Further, my Honors thesis was my largest completed project at the time of applying, which did not use health data (I made sure to address this discrepancy in my personal statement).

# Application Process 

## Where did I apply and why? 
I decided to apply to graduate programs in Biostatistics in September 2024 -- a little late. After conversations with mentors and family, I settled on my priorities in a program and decided that I wanted to go to a graduate program if it met all of my criteria. Therefore, I only  applied to 5 PhD programs and 1 Master's program, all in Biostatistics. Though 4/5 PhD programs had options to be considered for their Master's program if rejected from their PhD program, I selected that I would want to be considered for the MS for all four. \

In choosing programs, I was looking at:
* **Geography:** I wanted to be in a city with good public transit (I hate driving). 
* **Program requirements:** I did not take the GRE and did not have plans to; therefore, I ruled out all schools that required it.
* **Type of research:** I am interested in longitudinal modeling + causal inference, so I looked for faculty that overlapped with my interests.
* **Connections to outside institutions:** I wanted a program to be heavily intertwined with local institutions (i.e. state health departments, local hospitals, non-profits). This was super important to me because it shows a deep commitment to improving health outcomes, versus only researching them. Also, I am interested in working as an applied biostatistician either post-grad or as an internship, so these ties would also allow me to build my own network.
* **Recent graduate outcomes:** This was typically a question I asked in an interview, but I wanted to see diversity in the steps after graduating from the program.
* **Support system:** Though this wasn't a complete dealbreaker for me, it led me to consider schools that were near friends or family.
* **Program intensity and ranking:** Most programs post their typical 5-year timeline somewhere on their website -- I ensured that their timeline lined up seemed both challenging (which is a given) but also _doable_. I also considered ranking when I was making my list.

My list of schools is as follows:

|    School     | Program |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Boston University  | PhD  |
| Brown University  | PhD |
| Columbia University  | PhD |
| University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill  | PhD |
| University of Minnesota | Masters |
| University of Washington | PhD only |

## Materials
After I finalized the list of schools, it was time to start putting together my application materials. If possible, I highly recommend starting early and asking professionals in that field to look over your materials. 
### CV
Here is the [CV](/petomer-website/Tomer_CV_November2024.pdf) I used to apply to schools.

### Statement of purpose
The statement of purpose (IMO) is the most important part of your application -- which is a good thing! You have an opportunity to talk about _who you are_ and _why you want to get a PhD_. However, this can also be a lot of pressure. \
Schools have different prompts for what they want you to talk about (which I tailored each draft to their requests), but the overall message is generally the same: 
* Why are you pursuing a PhD.
* Why will you be a successful candidate in a PhD program.
* Why the school in question is the right fit for your PhD studies.
\
To write my first draft of the statement, I based it on one school's prompt to not get so overwhelmed. I felt that if I could nail down the three questions above, it would be easier to write the statement for the other schools. \
After finalizing a draft of this initial statement through agonizing read-throughs and edits from my mentors, I then went school by school to make personalized statements for each of them. This meant a lot of copy and pasting the sections about me from the original statement (the reasons I'm pursuing a PhD stayed the same), but the paragraphs about each school shifted. I made sure to highlight why I am applying to the school and how it connects with my long-term goals. For my final paragraph, I tried to place myself in the department by naming faculty who have research of interest. \

A basic outline of my statement looked like this (reminder: this is what I found that worked best for me, and it may not work best for everyone):
1. Introduction: Who I am, how I became interested in biostatistics, and my overall reason for pursuing a PhD.
2. First body paragraph: Why the school/program? I would frequently mention the connections to local institutions here, because that was important to me.
3. Second body paragraph: Why I will be a successful candidate at the school -- more details about who I am as a biostatistician, highlighting previous experiences and strengths.
4. Third + fourth body paragraphs: Specific research projects that I have completed, using active language.
5. Fifth-sixth body paragraphs: How my previous experiences have shaped my research interests -> how my research interests fit into the school in question (naming specific faculty + centers)
6. Seventh body paragraph: A short summary statement further contextualizing how I will be successful at the school, and how the school will shape me.
\
I was also grateful to have proofreaders both outside of the field (shoutout to my parents for helping me edit when I couldn't look at it anymore) and within the field -- my current PI helped me restructure the statement early on to flow better. \


### Personal statement
I found that personal statement prompts widely differed between schools, with some not even requiring them. The prompts typically centered around diversity and inclusion, asking about how my background and experiences make me able to contribute to/benefit from a school's community. In this case, I talked about my volunteering and tutoring experiences, showcasing how making math accessible has been a theme throughout my life. 

# Interview process
After submitting my applications in November, it was time to wait for schools to review them. I was lucky to be traveling home for the holidays with plenty of distractions, which helped me navigate the month of December. However, I was refreshing my email constantly, waiting for responses. I learned that universities not only differ from each other in their timeline, but also differ from their previous year timelines. \
In December and January, I received three interview invites (Columbia - in-person interview day invite received in mid-December; Brown - virtual interview day invite received in mid January, one week before the day itself; UW - virtual 'informal' interview invite received late January for the following week) and one waitlist (Boston U - received early January, no interview). \

Interviews at all three schools looked wildly different. At Brown, I attended the virtual interview day, which was mostly talks from faculty and students in the department, with 3 15-minute interviews built in with faculty I requested. The time limit of the interviews was a challenge, but all the faculty were friendly,y and the interviews themselves felt more like conversations. \

My next interview was with the University of Washington in early February. This was a more formal interview style than I experienced at Brown. I met with two faculty members (the chair and a professor in the department) who had a set list of questions they wanted to ask me. The interview was scheduled to be 30 minutes, but it lasted about an hour. Their questions ended around the 20-minute mark, but they asked if I had any questions -- so the last part of that hour was more of an informal conversation than the first part, with conversation stemming from the questions I asked them. \

My last interview was in person at Columbia. The day was very similar to Brown's interview day, with an overview of the department from the chair, research talks from faculty, and time to meet with students. There were 3 20-minute interviews built in as well. These were very conversational, though I had studied at Columbia before, so I knew two of the faculty I was interviewing with, which helped. 

# Next Steps
Okay, now we have reached the point where my experience was heavily impacted by external factors. In early February, Donald Trump announced intentions to cut grants, reform the NIH, and cap indirect costs. This led to the admissions of every school on my list to be put on pause -- as they weren't sure what was going to happen. Therefore, the rest of my experience is (hopefully) not generalizable. The months of February - April were so filled with anxiety, watching the field I applied for slowly disappear. Therefore, for my sanity, I'm only going to write a short rundown of the admission decisions from each school. \

First, I received admission to U of M's MS program, but did not receive any funding support, which was a dealbreaker for me. \

Then, fter reaching out to BU, I learned that they were not admitting anyone off the waitlist, but I was offered a fair scholarship to their MS program by the end. Brown did not give many details about the admission freeze post-interview, and I did not hear from them until receiving a rejection in early April. I assume I was on some sort of waiting list for both Brown and UNC (from which I received a rejection in late April). \

Columbia was honest and positive with me, letting me know that I would have received admission in a _normal_ year. They delayed finalizing a decision for me until I reached out a week before decision day, letting them know I received a UW offer. They then let me know that there are no more spots in this program. This was the hardest rejection for me:  getting so close while having experience with the school made me very disappointed by this outcome. 

Ok, so... there's only one left: \

About a week after UW's interview, I received an invitation to visit day in late March (delayed due to uncertainty). The visit day was without an offer of admission and had scheduled interviews with faculty; basically, it was an interview day pt II. The day was similar to that of Brown/Columbia, with talks about the program, research, and geography throughout the day. My interviews were 15 minutes long with a faculty member of my choice and another visiting prospective student. \

A week later, I received my first(!) and only admission letter, with the funding letter following suit. I have since learned that, out of ~13 students who were there on Visit Day, only 3 were extended offers. I wish I could share more about what I said or did during interview/Visit Day that made me one of these three, but I honestly have no idea. I am still stunned by it. I am so thankful for this opportunity.
