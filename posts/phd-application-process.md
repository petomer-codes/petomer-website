title: Biostatistics PhD Application Process
---

When I was in the depths of applying to PhD programs, blog posts by [Kat Hoffman](https://www.khstats.com/blog/phd-apps/), [Daniel Posmik](https://posmikdc.github.io/), and [Simon Couch](https://www.simonpcouch.com/blog/2021-03-15-apply-to-stats-grad-school/) got me through. Because of them and the way I read their posts religiously, I wanted to continue the tradition and contribute my own experience to the Biostatistics-PhD-Application-Process sphere. \
\
First, though, I wanted to begin with a disclaimer: \
I only applied for American universities for fall 2025 matriculation. My application process began normally, but the transition of power that occurred in January in the States drastically impacted the rest of my cycle. 
This administration proposed detrimental cuts to the NIH, which frightened (rightly so) and halted grants to many universities -- meaning that admissions were frozen for a long time, cohorts were cut, and offers were rescinded. 
I hope this was a temporary blip in the public health world, and that your cycle will be less impacted than mine, but it does mean some of my experiences will (_hopefully_) not be generalizable. 
\

## My Background: 
I am an American citizen born and raised in Pittsburgh, PA, but I attended middle and high school in Seattle, WA. I received my Bachelor of Arts from Macalester College, a small liberal arts school in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota. 
My major was Applied Mathematics and Statistics, with minors in Anthropology and Community & Global Health. I graduated _summa cum laude_ with Honors in Statistics, which I received after completing an Honors thesis my senior year.
My thesis stemmed from a Causal Inference class I took in my junior year spring, looking at the causes of home advantage in (specifically women's) professional soccer. I also had two health-focused research experiences at outside institutions (SIBDS @ Columbia; Study abroad independent study project @ Leiden University College -- The Hague).\
After graduating from Macalester, I moved to Durham-Chapel Hill, North Carolina, to start a position as a post-baccalaureate research fellow at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. There, I contributed to the Puberty and Cancer Group, part of the larger Epidemiology Branch. 
Despite being on the Epi side, my mentor and I worked together to develop projects for me that were highly technical with co-authors from the closely conjoined Biostatistics and Computational Biology Branch. 
\
## My Strengths: 
After doing a lot of reading, I decided that my strengths were as follows: 
* **Research fellowship:** My current job as a research fellow through the IRTA program has made me a better researcher and statistician. In this role, I have gotten to both lead and support publications.
* **Math & stats background:** For my degree, I had to take a lot of the classes that most programs either required or preferred, along with some statistics electives along the way. Taking these classes recently and doing well in them was a major strength of my application. 
* **Recommendation letters:** I got three strong letters from a former research advisor + professor, a former Real Analysis/Calculus professor, and my current PI. I covered the bases in these letters, with two speaking to my strengths and potential as a researcher, while the third talked about my mathematics background. 


## My Weaknesses:
* **No master's degree:** Not having an MS makes it a bigger commitment for schools to take you on -- it's at least another year of coursework combined with added uncertainty if a student is serious about a PhD.
* **Liberal arts background:** I am hesitant about putting this here -- but I was told not to apply to some schools because they do not accept many liberal arts students. On the flip side, some schools love liberal arts students, so it could be both.
* **Differing research interests:** None of my research projects follow the same method or topic. Further, my Honors thesis was my largest completed project at the time of applying, which did not use health data (I made sure to address this discrepancy in my personal statement).

# Application Process 

## Where did I apply and why? 
I decided to apply to graduate programs in Biostatistics in September 2024 -- a little late. After conversations with mentors and family, I settled on my priorities in a program and decided that I wanted to go to a graduate program if it met all of my criteria. Therefore, I only  applied to 5 PhD programs and 1 Master's program, all in Biostatistics. Though 4/5 PhD programs had options to be considered for their Master's program if rejected from their PhD program, I selected that I would want to be considered for the MS for all four. \

In choosing programs, I was looking at:
* **Geography:** I wanted to be in a city with good public transit (I hate driving). 
* **Program requirements:** I did not take the GRE and did not have plans to; therefore, I ruled out all schools that required it.
* **Type of research:** I am interested in longitudinal modeling + causal inference, so I looked for faculty that overlapped with my interests.
* **Connections to outside institutions:** I wanted a program to be heavily intertwined with local institutions (i.e. state health departments, local hospitals, non-profits). This was super important to me because it shows a deep commitment to improving health outcomes, versus only researching them. Also, I am interested in working as an applied biostatistician either post-grad or as an internship, so these ties would also allow me to build my own network.
* **Recent graduate outcomes:** This was typically a question I asked in an interview, but I wanted to see diversity in the steps after graduating from the program.
* **Support system:** Though this wasn't a complete dealbreaker for me, it led me to consider schools that were near friends or family.
* **Program intensity and ranking:** Most programs post their typical 5-year timeline somewhere on their website -- I ensured that their timeline lined up seemed both challenging (which is a given) but also _doable_. I also considered ranking when I was making my list.

My list of schools is as follows:

|    School     | Program |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Boston University  | PhD  |
| Brown University  | PhD |
| Columbia University  | PhD |
| University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill  | PhD |
| University of Minnesota | Masters |
| University of Washington | PhD only |

## Materials
After I finalized the list of schools, it was time to start putting together my application materials. If possible, I highly recommend starting early and asking professionals in that field to look over your materials. 
### CV
The [CV] (/petomer-website/Tomer_CV_November2024.pdf) I used to apply to schools is linked. A few comments I received during this process were to: 
* If you are in the early stages of publications, describe the project and your role.
* Include coursework information in the education section -- for me, the education section was my biggest strength with no peer-reviewed publications out and no MS, so this might change depending on the student.
* Use active language to describe responsibilities.
