title: Biostatistics PhD Application Process
---

When I was in the depths of applying to PhD programs, blog posts by [Kat Hoffman](https://www.khstats.com/blog/phd-apps/), [Daniel Posmik](https://posmikdc.github.io/), and [Simon Couch](https://www.simonpcouch.com/blog/2021-03-15-apply-to-stats-grad-school/) got me through. Because of them and the way I read their posts religiously, I wanted to continue the tradition and contribute my own experience to the Biostatistics-PhD-Application-Process sphere.
\
I wanted to begin with a disclaimer: \
I only applied for American universities for fall 2025 matriculation. My application process began normally, but the transition of power that occurred in Janurary in the States drastically impacted the rest of my cycle. 
This administration proposed detrimental cuts to the NIH which frightened (rightly so) and halted grants to many universities -- meaning that admissions were frozen for a long time, cohorts were cut, and offers were rescinded. 
I am hoping that this was a temporary blip in the public health world, and that your cycle will be less impacted than mine, but it does mean some of my experiences will (_hopefully_) not be generalizable. 
\

## My Background: 
I am an American citizen born and raised in Pittsburgh, PA, but I attended middle and high school in Seattle, WA. I received my Bacheler of Arts from Macalester College, a small liberal arts school in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota. 
My major was Applied Mathematics and Statistics, with minors in Anthropology and Community & Global Health. I graduated _summa cum laude_ with Honors in Statistics, which I received after successfully completing an Honors thesis my senior year.
My thesis stemmed from a Causal Inference class I took my junior year spring, looking at the causes of home advantage in (specifcally women's) professional soccer. I also had two health-focused research experiences at outside institutions (SIBDS @ Columbia; Study abroad independent study project @ Leiden Univeristy College -- The Hague)
\
After graduating from Macalester, I moved to Durham-Chapel Hill, North Carolina to start a position as a post-baccalaureate research fellow at the National Institute of Environemntal Health Sciences. There, I contributed to the Puberty and Cancer Group which is part of the larger Epidemiology Branch. 
Despite being on the Epi side, my mentor and I worked together to develop projects for me that were highly technical with co-authors from the closely conjoined Biostatistics and Computational Biology Branch.

## Application Process 

# Why biostatistics? 
At the time of applying, I was working as a biostats-y student in Epidemiology, naturally making me compare Epidemiology v. Biostatistics programs. Here are the reasons
I stuck with biostatistics -- keep in mind that these are my opinions and experiences: 
* **Logistics:** Most Epi PhD programs require an MPH, which are typically unfunded.
* **Flexibility:** I like the felxibility of biostatistics to mold into different applicaitons. In my eyes, biostatistics is a field where you constantly learn new things from experts. 
* I did not want to completely abandon my roots -- I was a mathematics and statistics student before I applied it to public health issues. Though I find this application the most fulfilling I have discovered, I wanted to stay true to myself as a student and person.
* 

# Where did I apply and why? 
I decided to apply to graduate programs in Biostatistics in September, 2024 -- a little late. After conversations with mentors and family, I settled on my priorities in a program and decided that I wanted to go to a graduate program if it met all of my criteria. Therefore, I only  applied to 5 PhD programs and 1 Masters program, all in Biostatistics. Though, 4/5 PhD programs had options to be considered for their Masters program if rejected from their PhD program -- I selected that I would want to be considered for the MS for all four. \
