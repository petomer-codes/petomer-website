## Hi, I'm Paige (she/her) and welcome to my website!

I created this website to be a publicly accessible repository of my research and personal projects. I'm excited to have this platform to share my work and life with you.

# Here's a bit more about me, academically:

- I am starting my PhD program in **Biostatistics** this fall at the University of Washington. I'll have a post soon about my application process.
- I received my **Bachelors of Arts** in Applied Mathematics and Statistics from Macalester College (Twin Cities, MN) in 2024. My minors were **Anthropology** and **Community & Global Health**.
- While at Macalester, I completed an Honors project using causal inference in professional soccer data.
- I am currently a research fellow in the Durham-Chapel Hill area, and my research right now uses **longitudinal modeling** to look at associations between **puberty and cancer**.
- My [CV](Tomer-CV-website.pdf) has more information.

# A bit about me, outside of math:

- I'm from the **Seattle area** in Washington, so, this summer, I'll be moving back home for the first time in 5 years.
- I love reading, running, and resting: my big 3!
  - I have had more free time this past year, so I have challenged myself to pick up books and genres that I normally would not read (i.e., *Straight* by Dick Francis).
  - I started running about 2 years ago after playing soccer all of my life. I'm planning to run my first half marathon this fall in Seattle!
  - And resting is resting, self-explanatory. I love laying in the sun or in my bed with my orange cat, Goose.
- I also love to do yoga, try new food + recipes, and drink good coffee.
