title: Welcome to my blog

Hi! My name is Paige (she/her) and welcome to my website. I created this to be a repository of my research along with some personal entries. A little bit about me while you're here: I'm an incoming first-year Biostatistics PhD student at the University of Washington, but I'm currently a research fellow in Durham, NC:). I graduated in 2024 with a Bachelors degree in Applied Math and Statistics major, with minors in Anrhtopology and Global Health. I am going into biostatistics because I have loved math all of my life, and I think it is so cool that you can use math to help people. 
Outside of statistics, I love to run, do yoga, read, drink coffee or a cocktail, and hang with my orange cat, Goose.
