Welcome to my website! Here's a bit more about me, academically: 
* My name is Paige (she/her) and I have _finally_ made a website to share my research and life with you! 
* I am starting my PhD program in Biostatistics this fall at the University of Washington -- I'll have a post soon about my application process. 
* I received my Bachelors of Arts in Applied Mathematics and Statistics from Macalester College in 2024. I loved my time at Macalester and in the Twin Cities, MN. 
* I am currently a research fellow in the Durham-Chapel Hill area, and my research right now uses longitudinal modeling to look at associations between puberty and cancer.

A bit about me, personally: 
* I'm actually from the Seattle area in Washington, so I am looking forward to being closer to my parents after 5 years!
* I love reading, running, and resting: my big 3! I have had more free time this past year, so I have challenged myself to picking up books and genres that I normally would not read (i.e. _Straight_ by Dick Francis). In running, I started about 2 years ago after playing soccer all of my life. I'm hoping to run my frist half marathon this fall in Seattle! And resting is resting, self explanatory -- I love my bed!
