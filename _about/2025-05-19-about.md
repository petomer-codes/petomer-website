Welcome to my website! Here's a bit more about me, academically: 
* My name is Paige (she/her) and I am a Biostatistics student. 
* I am starting my PhD program this fall at the University of Washington -- I'll have a post soon about my application process. 
* I received my Bachelors of Arts in Applied Mathematics and Statistics from Macalester College in 2024. I loved my time at Macalester and in the Twin Cities, MN. 
* I am currently a research fellow in the Durham-Chapel Hill area, and my research right now uses longitudinal modeling to look at associations between puberty and cancer.
